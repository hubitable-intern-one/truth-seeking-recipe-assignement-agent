Use a large, deep pot and a strainer skimmer (used for lowering food into oil and removing excess oil while cooking) to deep fry at home, or if you have the space in your kitchen, opt for a countertop deep fryer. The cook times of both deep and air fryers differ depending on what you’re cooking. While deep fryers offer traditional flavor, air fryers and ovens with air fry features can provide more variety. Air fryers can be a healthier choice, using less oil and producing lighter meals compared to deep frying.",

Read this guide to learn more about the difference between air fryers vs deep fryers and which appliance is right for you. The difference between an air fryer and a deep fryer lies primarily with the process of frying food. Whereas deep fryers submerge food in batches of oil to achieve a crispy texture, air fryers use a modest amount of oil, relying instead on an internal heating element and airflow to achieve a delicious effect. When thinking about the taste difference between air frying and deep frying, it is also important to think about how the food is cooked. You can enjoy crispy and delicious low-oil versions of deep fried foods with a Whirlpool® range with air fry.",
